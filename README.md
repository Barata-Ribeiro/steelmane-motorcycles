# SteelMane Motorcycles Website

This website was developed during the "UI Design for Beginners" and the "HTML and CSS for Beginners" courses from [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com). Instead of using the Bikcraft brand from the courses, I created the SteelMane Motorcycles brand as an alternative. The brand is entirely fictional, with the purpose of showcasing customized and totally original motorcycles.

## Technologies Used

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript (barely)

## Features

## Known Limitations

I have not implemented PHP due to the need for a hosting service. As a result, the forms only redirect to the same page with an error message developed in JavaScript, which is necessary for the form to work.
